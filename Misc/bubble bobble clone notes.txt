how to make ai jump?
-> look ahead 1-2 groundtiles, if it's empty, measure gap (count missing blocks)

decide next move in regular intervals
->change direction, run, jump forward/jump up/drop

stomp: pop bubbles by standing on them for very short time
17:00-17:24
tried to fix the broken bubble bobble sprite sheet
-> took too long, cancelled
17:24-17:34
implemented shoot via animation player:
	timeframe where player has attack zone (teeth) in front
	todo: implement the attack area and position it according to horizontal orientation

19:50-21:16
implemented :
	-teeth hitbox open for short duration after shooting, 
	 so bubbled enemies get eaten immediately
	-teeth are one the front side of the player

16:30-16:45 study ai behavior
theory:
	set spawn points:
	all monsters start floating down at beginning of level at the same time, same speed.
	their start positions may be mid air
	they are stuck in idle animation (immune to gravity) until each mob has arrived.
	as soon as all mobs have arrived, their movement patterns, and gravity kick in.
	
	monsters start positions are grid aligned.
	the grid is half boxes (or small boxes).
	i.e. they either spawn on the boundary of two small boxes
	(or in the middle of a large box, or one the boundary between two large boxes)

learn how to make a custom node, where i can give a drop down to select enum
and then have the object render a different image in game,
and also do the same in the editor
for this, i learned how to define a custom setter for properties in godot

-> _redraw()
-> queue_redraw()
-> call queue_redraw within the setter
-> @tool # have to reload project

learned and practiced creating 
custom Resource, with script attached and using it in another scripted scene
learned about enums being dictionaries
and dictionaries being variable-typed
